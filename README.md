# - How to use it
- First you download `python`, then after `installing python`, you open the folder and run the `install.exe` in the folder. After the download is complete, it will give you a warning. After pressing enter, continue and run `Prime Bot.exe`, the program will start and you can log in to `apex legends`, but you can use the `jump button. You need to get the f key!!!`

- If everything worked properly, when you launch the application you should see this window:

- To use the program, your resolution must be `1920x1080p!`

# Important to Know
- **Keep your screen turned on while you are having the bot AFK, it works by mimicking a player, so you have to have Apex visible and fullscreen.**
- **If you interact with Apex while the bot is active, it might get stuck.**
- **Allow up to 30 seconds of having you Apex running in full screen for the bot to start.**
- **Your Apex has to be in mouse in keyboard mode. If parts of the menu have controller buttons shown instead of m/kb buttons shown, it can cause the bot not to work. If your Apex is in controller mode, a quick fix is to press a button on your keyboard, or to move your mouse a little.**
- **You need to throw the jump key to the `F key.`**

# Quick Fixes
- If your monitor is a different resolution and or aspect ratio than 1080P in apex you can change this in settings->`video`. Change your aspex ratio to 16:9 and resolution to `1920 x 1080`.
